# Controlled-Car-with-Shortest-Path-Guide-Ai-Version-
This project has 2 versions. The first is to simply give the shortest path, and the second has an AI version.Â 

A Pygame-based interactive game where players navigate a car through a grid to reach a goal, avoiding obstacles. Features include dynamic shortest-path guidance using Dijkstra's algorithm and a loading screen with animation.

Features:
Shortest Path Guidance: Highlights the optimal path dynamically.
Randomized Grid: New obstacles are generated for each game.
Interactive Controls: Move the car using arrow keys.
Goal Feedback: Displays a message and move count upon reaching the goal.

Controls:
Arrow Keys: Navigate the car.
